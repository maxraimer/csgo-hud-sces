### Known bugs:
1. When the score-by-map is 1:0, and the first half of the 2nd map is played, both teams "get point", like both of them won first map.
2. ~~CT-side players' sidebar doesn't draw-out defuser kit icon if player has.~~
3. ~~*Was found at Navi against Heroic match on the Inferno map on PGL Major.* S1mple's AWP had "undefined" ammo reserve. Only S1mple. Only on Inferno.~~
4. ~~*The same match, but Ancient.* Player of Heroic had AK, spectator window showed AK, but sidebar showed his secondary weapon.~~
5. ~~The length of the HP-bar of the sidebars counting wrong way.~~
6. ~~Wrong timeout info in timeout bar.~~
