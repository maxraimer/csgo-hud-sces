# SCES CS:GO GOTV Spectator hud


### Known bugs:
1. When the score-by-map is 1:0, and the first half of the 2nd map is played, both teams "get point", like both of them won first map.
2. CT-side players' sidebar doesn't draw-out defuser kit icon if player has.
3. *Was found at Navi against Heroic match on the Inferno map on PGL Major.* S1mple's AWP had "undefined" ammo reserve. Only S1mple. Only on Inferno.
4. *The same match, but Ancient.* Player of Heroic had AK, spectator window showed AK, but sidebar showed his secondary weapon.
5. The length of the HP-bar of the sidebars counting wrong way.
